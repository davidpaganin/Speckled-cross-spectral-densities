%\end{abstract}

\begin{abstract}
We consider a realistic model for calculating the cross-spectral density of partially coherent beams from an x-ray undulator in a modern storage ring.  This two-point coherence function is seen to have a speckled structure associated with the presence of x-ray coherence vortices and domain walls.  Such cross-spectral density speckle is associated with a network of spatial pairs of points for which there is zero correlation.  X-ray coherence vortices and domain walls are seen to emerge naturally as the number of coherent modes required increases.  An understanding of the existence and nature of such correlation singularities enhances our ability to exploit partially coherent x-ray radiation from new or upgraded synchrotron sources, for both imaging and diffraction applications.

\section{Introduction}

Synchrotron radiation (SR) has witnessed enormous growth in recent decades, largely due to its applicability to multidisciplinary applied science. In particular, many experimental techniques have recently (or relatively recently) been developed to exploit the coherence of SR, such as x-ray photon correlation spectroscopy \cite{XPCS}, coherent diffraction imaging \cite{CDI}, propagation-based phase contrast imaging \cite{PBPCI} and ptychography \cite{Ptychography}. 

Many storage-ring based x-ray synchrotron facilities are building or planning upgrades to increase brilliance and coherent flux by one to three orders of magnitude.  The first upgrade of a large facility will be the EBS (Extremely Brilliant Source) \cite{orangebook} at the European Synchrotron Radiation Facility (ESRF), aiming to build a storage ring of 150 pm emittance to significantly boost the associated x-ray coherence.

Accurate calculation and quantitative evaluation of the parameters related to x-ray coherence, in such new storage rings, is of paramount importance for designing, building and exploiting the new beamlines. In this context an algorithm to calculate the cross spectral density (CSD) of radiation emitted by modern x-ray undulators has been developed \cite{glass}.  The CSD quantifies two-point correlation properties of partially coherent statistically stationary fields \cite{Wolf1982,mandel_wolf}.  For Gaussian statistics, the CSD completely characterises its properties since the Gaussian moment theorem implies all higher-order correlation functions either (i) vanish or (ii) are expressible in terms of the two-point correlation.  Two-point correlation functions are therefore a key input needed to properly model any subsequent x-ray data obtained by streaming x-ray CSDs through subsequent optical elements and samples, and finally through to the detected spectral density.  

Here we consider the role played by the phase of the CSD \cite{Schouten2003,GburVisser2003,Bogatyryova2003}. This phase, which governs the position of Young-type interference fringes formed when the disturbance from two different spatial points is combined at a given angular frequency \cite{mandel_wolf}, influences detected spectral densities in both imaging and non-imaging contexts.  As discussed later, this CSD phase can and typically will possess a network of both 
(i) domain walls across which the CSD phase is discontinuous, and (ii) branch lines around which it has a non-zero winding number; at either of these CSD phase singularities, the CSD vanishes \cite{TopologicalReactionsCohVortices,Marasinghe2010}.  Thus, even for highly coherent sources such as that considered in the present paper, a complicated network of infinitely many pairs of points will typically exist, for which the x-ray disturbance is totally uncorrelated.  While such ``correlation singularities'' have received attention in a visible-light setting \cite{Schouten2003,GburVisser2003,Bogatyryova2003,FischerVisser2004,Palacios2004,GburVisser2006,Wang2006,TopologicalReactionsCohVortices,GburVisser2010,Rodrigo2015}, relatively little work exists in an x-ray context.  An exception is a certain simple model for a partially coherent x-ray source, which contains embedded correlation singularities in its associated CSD phase  \cite{PellicciaPaganin2012}. Note also that the Schell model of partially coherent scalar fields\cite{mandel_wolf}, which has been applied to x rays \cite{Coisson1997,Vartanyants2010}, can contain embedded CSD correlation singularities when generalised e.g.~to Laguerre--Gauss Schell beams \cite{Palacios2004,Rodrigo2015}.  Gauss--Schell beams do not contain correlation singularities, however when such beams pass through samples then such singularities may develop. In the present paper we find spontaneously-nucleated correlation singularities in the CSD to be implied by a realistic modern x-ray undulator model, together with an associated speckled CSD structure. Such correlation singularities can have subtle effects on both imaging and diffraction data, and as such they warrant further attention than they have hitherto received from the coherent-x-ray-optics community.  We note, however, that the broader conclusions and formalism of the present work extend beyond x-ray and visible light optics, to any partially coherent paraxial complex scalar fields that obey the Helmholtz equation in the monochromatic (mono energetic) limit.

Section 2 reviews relevant background regarding the cross-spectral density, including its coherent-mode representation and subsequent numerical evaluation for partially coherent x-ray sources.  This section also briefly reviews relevant background relating to coherence vortices and coherence domain walls, these being the two key correlation-function phase singularities for complex scalar fields.  All of this is formulated using the space--frequency description of partially coherent complex scalar electromagnetic fields.  As an example of the spontaneous formation of correlation singularities, Sec.~3 presents a numerical study of the cross-spectral density associated with an x-ray undulator, calculated at the source position.  Both coherence vortices (a structurally stable form of CSD correlation singularity), and an associated speckled structure to the CSD, are seen to emerge. Section 4 discusses propagation of the CSD calculated at the source, to different distances in both the near field and intermediate field. Section 5 discusses some broader implications of this work, and outlines avenues for future research.  Brief concluding remarks are given in Sec.~6.

\section{Background}

This section is divided into two parts.  We begin by briefly reviewing some relevant background regarding the space--frequency description of partially coherent scalar electromagnetic fields.  We then review some basic results regarding coherence vortices and domain walls in the cross-spectral density for partially coherent fields.  
\subsection{Cross-spectral density for x-ray synchrotron radiation}

The SR emitted by present storage rings is partially coherent, due to superposed single-electron emission. A single electron would emit a spatially coherent wavefront that can be calculated using classical electrodynamics \cite{jackson}. However, emission of individual electrons is incoherent among distinct electrons, since the bunch length greatly exceeds the radiation wavelength.  This latter point is always the case for storage-ring x-ray sources, but not for x-ray Free Electron Lasers. The fact that storage ring emittance is low implies the bunch transverse sizes to be small. An observer placed at a sufficiently long distance from the source (typical beamline lengths are 30--200m) would observe  radiation with a relatively high degree of  spatial coherence. Furthermore, if required, a high degree of temporal coherence can be obtained via monochromatisation.  Whether or not the x-ray beam is energy filtered, its partial coherence is due to the statistical distribution of the electrons in the storage ring. 

To completely describe second-order partial coherence properties, the CSD \cite{Wolf1982,mandel_wolf} may be used: 
\begin{eqnarray}
\nonumber W(x_1,y_1,z_1,x_2,y_2,z_2,\omega) \quad\quad\quad\quad \\ = \langle E^{*}(x_1,y_1,z_1,\omega) E(x_2,y_2,z_2,\omega) \rangle.\label{eq:CSD}
\end{eqnarray}
Here, $E$ is the complex (scalar) electric field at two spatial points $r_1=(x_1,y_1,z_2)$ and $r_2=(x_2,y_2,z_2)$, $\hbar\omega$ is the photon energy and $\hbar$ is the reduced Planck constant $h/(2\pi)$.  We follow the usual convention that $z$ denotes the optic axis with respect to which the electromagnetic disturbance is paraxial. The average, denoted by angular brackets above, is over a Gibbs-like statistical ensemble of strictly monochromatic fields, all of which have the same angular frequency $\omega$. We have implicitly assumed wide-sense statistical stationarity, which is satisfied by emission from storage rings \cite{geloni}. Also, the two observation points are usually in a plane perpendicular to the beam at a distance $z=z_1=z_2$ from the source. Therefore, for practical purposes the CSD is a four-dimensional function for a given $z$ and $\omega$: 
\begin{equation}
W(x_1,y_1,x_2,y_2,z,\omega) = 
\langle E^{*}(x_1,y_1,z,\omega) E(x_2,y_2,z,\omega)\rangle.
\end{equation}

Calculation of the CSD can be performed knowing the distribution of the electrons and the characteristics of the synchrotron-radiation emission. The ``convolution theorem'' of Kim \cite{kim} gives a practical procedure for calculating Wigner functions \cite{Wigner1932} and also the CSD. Note, in this context, that one-to-one mappings exist that transform the Wigner-function representation of the second-order coherence properties of a partially coherent field, to the CSD representation---and {\em vice versa} \cite{AlonsoWignerFunctionReview}.  However the numerical evaluation and storage is very computationally expensive, as one needs to sample such two-point correlation functions with high resolution (about $10^3$ samples per dimension, leading typically to on the order of $10^{12}$ complex numbers, requiring gigabytes to terabytes of computer memory storage). Moreover, the propagation in vacuum of the CSD from a plane with fixed $z_1$ to another plane with $z_2>z_1$ must be done using 4D integrals with the corresponding Green functions \cite{mandel_wolf}, which is certainly beyond the possibilities of present computers in scenarios with realistic levels of complexity. 

A significantly more efficient means to store the CSD uses the property that it can be represented in terms of eigenvalues $\lambda_m(\omega)$ and coherent modes $\phi_m(\vec{r}, \omega)$, via the coherent-mode expansion
\cite{Wolf1982,mandel_wolf}:
\begin{equation}
\begin{aligned}
W(\vec{r_1}, \vec{r_2}, \omega)
=
\sum_m
\lambda_m(\omega)
\phi_m^*(\vec{r_1},\omega)
\phi_m(\vec{r_2}, \omega).
\end{aligned}
\end{equation}

It can be shown that a fully coherent beam has a single coherent mode (index zero). For a partially coherent beam with high coherent fraction the first modes contain a large fraction of the total spectral density, so the truncated series is a good representation of the CSD. The main advantage of this expansion is that the the 4D CSD can be computed as a (truncated) sum of 2D modes, therefore making storage possible. Also, the propagated CSD can be computed from the sum of the propagated modes, each of which propagate in the same manner as a strictly coherent field, therefore one can propagate the CSD by performing 2D integrals (for each mode in the CSD) instead of 4D integrals (directly for CSD itself).  

The eigenvalues and associated coherent modes may be obtained as solutions of the following homogeneous Fredholm integral equation of second kind:
\begin{equation}
\begin{aligned}
\label{fredholm_equation}
\int d\vec{r_1}
W(\vec{r_1},\vec{r_2}, \omega){\phi}_m(\vec{r_1},
\omega)=\lambda_m(\omega)\phi_m(\vec{r_2}, \omega).
\end{aligned}
\end{equation}
These solutions may then be assembled into the coherent-mode representation of the CSD \cite{Wolf1982}.  This can be solved numerically, e.g.~using the computer package ``COherent Modes for SYnchrotron Light'' (COMSYL) \cite{glass}.

\subsection{Coherence vortices in the cross-spectral density}

Assume that the medium, through which a given statistically-stationary partially coherent forward-propagating complex scalar electromagnetic field propagates, to contain no discontinuities for any of the points $(x_1,y_1,z)$ and $(x_2,y_2,z)$ at which the cross-spectral density $W(x_1,y_1,x_2,y_2,z,\omega)$ is to be computed. This implies $W$ to be a continuous and single-valued complex function of all its coordinates.  Using an argument closely related to that of Dirac \citeyear{Dirac1931} in a different context, important general CSD properties may be derived from the assumption of single-valuedness and continuity, without needing to make any specific reference to the underpinning differential equations that govern the evolution of the CSD \cite{Marasinghe2010}. 

Let the CSD phase be denoted as follows:
\begin{equation}
\begin{aligned}
\label{phase_of_W}
\Phi(x_1,y_1,x_2,y_2,z,\omega)=\arg[W(x_1,y_1,x_2,y_2,z,\omega)]
\end{aligned}
\end{equation}
This quantity governs the position of Young-type interference fringes which would be formed, if one were to combine the disturbances $\alpha$ and $\beta$ scattered from points $(x_1,y_1,z)\equiv A$ and $(x_2,y_2,z)\equiv B$, respectively, at energy $\hbar\omega$ \cite{mandel_wolf}---see Fig.~\ref{loss_of_fringe_visibility}a. This CSD phase is complemented by the magnitude of the CSD, which governs the visibility of the previously-mentioned Young-type fringes.

\begin{figure}
\includegraphics[width=8.5cm]{Figures/coherence_vortex.png}
\caption{(a) The cross-spectral density $W(x,y,x',y',z=z',\omega)$ associated with a field $F$ quantifies the degree of correlation of the statistically stationary disturbance at points $(x,y,z)\equiv A$ and $(x',y',z'=z)\equiv B$. (b) For fixed $(x',y')$ and $\omega$ the phase (arg) of $W(x,y,x',y',z=z',\omega)$ has a coherence vortex as a function of $x$ and $y$, at a point enclosed within the contour $\Gamma$, about which the phase winds by an integer multiple of $2\pi$ radians.  See Eq.~\ref{phase_of_W_winding}.}
\label{loss_of_fringe_visibility}
\end{figure}

While $W\in\mathbb{C}$ and $|W|\in\mathbb{R}$ are both single-valued, $\Phi$ will in general be multi-valued. Indeed, since the phase of a complex number is only defined modulo $2\pi$, it may wind by an integer multiple $m$ of $2\pi$ (see Fig.~\ref{loss_of_fringe_visibility}b) \cite{GburVisser2003}: 
\begin{equation}
\begin{aligned}
\label{phase_of_W_winding}
\oint_{\Gamma} d\Phi(x_1,y_1,x_2,y_2,z,\omega)=2\pi m.
\end{aligned}
\end{equation}
Here, $\Gamma$ is any smooth closed clockwise-traversed one-dimensional curve embedded in the six-dimensional space with coordinates $(x_1,y_1,x_2,y_2,z,\omega)$, and $d\Phi$ is the increment in $\Phi$ corresponding to an infinitesimal line segment of $\Gamma$.  Admissible curves $\Gamma$ are those for which $W$ is non-zero at every point on $\Gamma$, ensuring $\Phi$ and hence $d\Phi$ to be well defined at each point on $\Gamma$.  We consider $\omega$ to have a fixed albeit arbitrary value throughout the paper, although this assumption may be easily dropped. Non-zero $m$ indicates non-trivial topology in the phase of $W$, with the corresponding phase map in Fig.~\ref{loss_of_fringe_visibility}b being one of infinitely many Riemann sheets describing a screw dislocation threaded by the coherence-vortex core. 

Non-zero $m$ indicates a coherence vortex \cite{GburVisser2003} to be present.  The integer $m$ is the {\em topological charge} of the coherence vortex.  Such structures are a partially-coherent analog of phase vortices that may form in the phase of coherent optical fields \cite{NyeBerry1974,Nye1999,SoskinVasnetsov2001,DennisProgOpt2009}.  Two key physical consequences of non-vanishing $m$ are outlined below.  These arguments are topological in nature, considering  generic structures that are stable with respect to continuous deformation of the underlying fields. 

The existence of any {\em one} circuit $\Gamma$ for which $m$ is non-zero, implies the presence of a (nodal) manifold of points in $(x_1,y_1,x_2,y_2,z,\omega)$-space, at each of which $W$ vanishes.  This is remarkable, since vanishing $W$ corresponds to the disturbance at two points being totally incoherent (i.e.~totally uncorrelated), even though the field may have a very high state of coherence. Such points are termed correlation singularities, nodal points, nodal lines, or a nodal manifold.  If $\Gamma$ lies in a particular two-dimensional plane $\Pi$ with coordinates $(\xi,\eta)$ within $(x_1,y_1,x_2,y_2,z,\omega)$-space, the so-called coherence vortex \cite{GburVisser2003} will typically occur at a (zero-dimensional) nodal point $(\xi_0,\eta_0)$ in the said plane, serving as a branch point for $\Phi$, about which $\Phi$ winds by $2 \pi m$ radians (cf.~the $m=1$ case in Fig.~\ref{loss_of_fringe_visibility}b).  The set of nodal points becomes a (one-dimensional) nodal line, or a connected set of nodal lines which either form closed loops or extend to the boundary of the considered region, when one considers the one-dimensional loop $\Gamma$ to be embedded within a three-dimensional hyperplane in  $(x_1,y_1,x_2,y_2,z,\omega)$-space.  This set of nodal lines (any point on which is a singular point for $\Phi$) may form a tree-like structure, e.g.~if an $m=2$ coherence vortex decays to a pair of $m=1$ coherence vortices \cite{TopologicalReactionsCohVortices,GburSPIE}.  Knotted and braided coherence-vortex nodal lines in $W$ are also topologically possible, albeit exotic.  Permissible nodes in tree-like nodal-line structures in $W$ are governed by the law of conservation of topological charge.  This set of nodal lines becomes a two-dimensional network of nodal sheets (zero sheets) in any four-dimensional hyperplane within the $(x_1,y_1,x_2,y_2,z,\omega)$-space, and a three-dimensional manifold of nodal points in any five-dimensional hyperplane subset of $(x_1,y_1,x_2,y_2,z,\omega)$-space.  Finally, in the full six-dimensional $(x_1,y_1,x_2,y_2,z,\omega)$-space, the set of nodal points of $W$ will form a four-dimensional network of points $C$, at each of which $W$ vanishes \cite{Marasinghe2010}.  

These nodal points in $W$ exhibit ``complete destructive interference of coherence''.  Stated more precisely, any point $(x_1',y_1',x_2',y_2',z',\omega)$ in the correlation-singularity manifold $C$ will correspond to a pair of spatial points $(x_1',y_1',z')\equiv A$ and $(x_2',y_2',z')\equiv B$ for which the partially-coherent disturbance is completely uncorrelated at angular frequency $\omega$ \cite{Schouten2003,GburVisser2003,Bogatyryova2003}.  If, for example, a point scatterer were to be placed at $A$, with another point scatterer at $B$, and the radiation scattered from both points allowed to overlap, no interference fringes would be observed at angular frequency $\omega$.  See the gray curve (curve 1) in Fig.~\ref{Young_fringe_anholonomy}.  The manifold of points $C$, which will typically permeate much of the $(x_1,y_1,x_2,y_2,z,\omega)$-space associated with cross-spectral densities calculated for non-trivial systems \cite{TopologicalReactionsCohVortices,GburVisser2003}, is ``a web of incoherence'' permeating a partially-coherent field's cross-spectral density.

\begin{figure}
\includegraphics[width=8.5cm]{Figures/Anholonomy.png}
\caption{Ratcheting of Young-type interferograms associated with an $m=1$ coherence vortex.  (a) A series of Young-type interferometers is constructed.  In all of these setups, radiation illuminates a screen in which the first of two pinholes is always at $B$.  The second pinhole is placed at $A$, before being moved through the cycle of locations $C1 \rightarrow C2 \rightarrow C3 \rightarrow C4 \rightarrow C1$.  (b) The resulting Young-type intereferograms, over some plane downstream of the points scatterers, are shown in curves 1 (pinholes $A$ and $B$), 2 ($C1$ and $B$), 3 ($C2$ and $B$), 4 ($C3$ and $B$), 5 ($C4$ and $B$) and 6 ($C1$ and $B$) respectively. Note that curves 2 and 6 are identical.  Also, $I(x)$ denotes the spectral density of the interferogram as a function of the transverse coordinate $x$, perpendicular to the optic axis.}
\label{Young_fringe_anholonomy}
\end{figure}

A second key consequence, of the coherence-vortex web permeating the cross-spectral density, is again related to the visibility of interference fringes associated with pairs of scattering points.  As previously stated, when pinholes are placed at locations $A$ and $B$ in Fig.~\ref{loss_of_fringe_visibility} that correspond to a coherence vortex (see also Fig.~\ref{Young_fringe_anholonomy}a), there is zero fringe visibility in the associated Young-type pattern filtered to energy $\hbar \omega$: see curve 1 in Fig.~\ref{Young_fringe_anholonomy}b.  However, the non-zero fringe visibility is regained if one moves ``off the coherence vortex'' by shifting the first pinhole from location $A$ to location $C1$: see curve 2 in Fig.~\ref{Young_fringe_anholonomy}b.  The vortical nature of the coherence vortex is then evident if one performs a sequence of Young-type interference experiments, where the pinhole at $B$ is kept fixed, while the pinhole at $C1$ is moved through the cycle of locations $C1$ (curve 2)$\rightarrow C2$ (curve 3)$\rightarrow C3$ (curve 4)$\rightarrow C4$ (curve 5)$\rightarrow C1$ (curve 6 = curve 2). If one traces the evolution of the intensity maxima associated with the sequence of Young-type interferograms in curves 2 to 6, the physical meaning of $m$ becomes clear: during the cycle, if $m=1$ then the maxima of the interferogram will ``ratchet'' to the right by one fringe during the cycle. If $m=-1$ they would instead ratchet to the left by one fringe during the cycle.  For general $m$, the fringes would ratchet to the right (left) by $|m|$ fringes, if $m$ is positive (negative) \cite{Marasinghe2010}.

In addition to the coherence vortex, a second type of CSD phase singularity exists: the domain wall.  These were the first-discovered form of CSD phase singularity \cite{Schouten2003}.  Such defects are stable for real correlation functions, but not for complex correlation functions such as the CSD.  However, if one has a dominant mode in the coherent-mode expansion of the CSD \cite{mandel_wolf}, the CSD may be ``close to real''; alternatively, there are important cases where the CSD is indeed real \cite{Schouten2003}.  In both instances, CSD phase domain walls may exist, with $\pi$ phase shift at points where the CSD changes sign.  As with the coherence vortex, $|W|=0$ at CSD domain walls.  The dimension of a domain-wall CSD singularity network in $(x_1,y_1,x_2,y_2,z,\omega)$-space, if it exists, is one higher than for a corresponding coherence-vortex network.  

\section{Simulations}

The coherent mode decomposition for x-ray radiation emitted by a 1.4 meter long U18 undulator (period 18.3 mm), which is to be placed at the centre of the straight section of the EBS (6 GeV, 147 pm~rad emittance storage ring), is here performed using COMSYL. The undulator is tuned to 17.226 keV (K=0.411) and the flux is 2.8$\times 10^{14}$ photons/s/0.1\%bw in a 1$\times$1 mm$^2$ aperture at 30 m. Figure~\ref{cumulative_mode_occupation} shows the cumulative mode occupation versus maximum mode index $n$, using the definition
\begin{equation}
\begin{aligned}
\label{spectrum}
d_n=\frac{\sum_{m=0}^{n} \lambda_m}{\sum_{m=0}^{\infty} \lambda_m}.
\end{aligned}
\end{equation}

The 1100 coherent modes calculated contain almost all (98\%) of the emitted radiation. The coherence fraction (occupation of first mode) is 2.8\%. The accumulation of the first 10 modes contains 21.7\% of the emitted intensity, followed by 33.0\% (20 modes), 73.3\% (100 modes) and 97.9\% (1000 modes). 
Figure~\ref{spectral_density} shows the spatial extension of the spectral density at the source plane, and also the extension of the first mode.

Figure~\ref{cumulative_mode_occupation} shows a few hundred modes to be needed to represent more than 90\% of the spectral density. The spectral density FWHM (full width at half maximum) has dimensions 71.3$\times$10.9 $\mu$m$^2$. This agrees well with simple estimates considering the source size as a convolution of the undulator emission: $\sigma_\gamma\approx (2.74/4\pi) \sqrt{\lambda L}\approx$9.6 $\mu$m ($\lambda$ is the radiation wavelength and $L$ is the undulator length) with the electron-bunch size ($\sigma_x$=30.2$\mu$m, and $\sigma_y$=1.37$\mu$m for the EBS straight section). The resulting FWHM values are 71.3$\times$10.0 $\mu$m$^2$. The size (FWHM) of the first mode is 12.4$\times$6.11 $\mu$m$^2$.

\end{figure}

Note from Fig.~\ref{spectral_density} that the first coherent mode is non-zero (or, more precisely, non-negligible) over an area which is smaller than the area over which the spectral density is non-zero (non-negligible). Such a property will typically be true for a large class of partially-coherent beams, which will necessarily have at least two coherent modes since they are not fully coherent, by assumption.  This typical property follows directly from the fact that the spectral density of the beam is given by the sum of the spectral densities of each of the coherent modes, hence the area over which the spectral density is non-negligible is always non-contracting as one adds progressively more coherent modes, irrespective of the particular non-zero eigenvalues associated with the modes.  

For the example in Fig.~\ref{spectral_density}, the region over which the total spectral density is greater than some threshold value (say, 1\% of the maximum value) is roughly elliptical.  Denote this essential support of the spectral density by $\mathcal{S}$.  If the cross-spectral density were to vanish for any pair of points $(r_1,r_2)$, with $r_1 \in \mathcal{S}$ and $r_2 \in \mathcal{S}$, then this must be associated with a zero of the spectral degree of coherence $\mu$ (normalised cross-spectral density, see e.g.~p.~171 of the text by Mandel and Wolf \cite{mandel_wolf}) \cite{GburSPIE}. %\textcolor{red}{\cite{GburSPIE}. The proof of this fact  \cite{GburSPIE} is as follows.  Recall that the cross-spectral density $W$, spectral density $S$ and \textcolor{red}{spectral degree of coherence} (normalized CSD) $\mu$ are related by $W(r_1,r_2,\omega)=\sqrt{S(r_1,\omega)}\sqrt{S(r_2,\omega)}\mu(r_1,r_2,\omega)$.  Since, by construction, $S(r_1,\omega)$ cannot vanish when $r_1 \in \mathcal{S}$, and $S(r_2,\omega)$ cannot vanish when $r_2 \in \mathcal{S}$, the null factor law implies that $W(r_1\in \mathcal{S},r_2\in \mathcal{S},\omega)$ can vanish if and only if $\mu(r_1\in \mathcal{S},r_2\in \mathcal{S},\omega)$ vanishes. I WOULD REMOVE THIS DEMONSTRATION??}
If there is one dominant coherent mode, it will typically be difficult to attain such zeros of the spectral degree of coherence, when both $r_1$ and $r_2$ lie within the region where the intensity of the first coherent mode is large.  This restriction vanishes when either or both of $r_1$ and $r_2$ lie outside the essential support of the dominant coherent mode.

\end{figure}

Returning to the numerical simulation, our next task is to extract CSD phase $\Phi$. Being a four-dimensional function when both $z$ and $\omega$ are considered fixed, it is convenient to fix two two further variables (e.g.~components of the position $\vec{r_2}$) and observe how $\Phi$ depends on the other two transverse spatial coordinates. Several points have been chosen: see Fig.~\ref{eye}. The first position (point $A$) is at the centre of the emission. The second (point $B$) is at a non-centered position where the first mode has appreciable intensity. The third (point $C$) is outside the first mode, but in a place with appreciable intensity.

When $\vec{r_2}$ is set to position $A$, we have the plot of the phase $\Phi(x,y,x_A,y_A)$ of the CSD in the left column of Fig.~\ref{pointP}, as a function of the coordinates $(x,y)$ of $\vec{r_2}$, with $z_1=z_2=z$ and $\hbar\omega$ all having the previously-indicated fixed values.  The brightness of the displayed phase has been taken to be proportional to $|W(x,y,x_A,y_A)|$, since CSD phase is not meaningful when $|W(x,y,x_A,y_A)|$ is negligible.  The figure shows four maps for the CSD phase, corresponding to the number $n$ of coherent modes being 1, 10, 100, and 1000 (top to bottom).  When only one coherent mode is included, there are no topological defects in the CSD phase.  However, when 10 coherent modes are included, domain-wall defects in the CSD appear.  Across each of these CSI-phase domain walls, the phase $\Phi$ of the CSD jumps by $\pi$ radians, with the CSD itself vanishing along each of the lines through which $\Phi$ changes discontinuously.  Adding more coherent modes, to the case of $n=100$, the domain walls become curved and the domain over which the CSD is non-negligible widens.  Finally, for the case  $n=1000$, the effect of the increasing number of coherent modes is to narrow the region over which the CSD is non-negligible.  The general trend from top panel through the bottom one is therefore a reduction in the spatial extent over which two-point field correlations have a magnitude $|W(x,y,x_A,y_A)|$ that is non-negligible, when one of the points is taken to be $A=(x_A,y_A)$, at the beam center.      

When $\vec{r_2}$ is set to position $B$, we have the plot of the phase $\Phi(x,y,x_B,y_B)$ of the CSD in the middle column of Fig.~\ref{pointP}, as a function of the coordinates $(x,y)$ of $\vec{r_1}$.  This figure again shows four maps for CSD phase, corresponding to the $n=1,10,100,1000$ coherent modes.  A similar trend to the left column is observed with regard to CSD domain walls.  However, in the middle column the additional feature of coherence vortices is present.  As one adds more coherent modes, to the singularity-free case of $n=1$ which is shown in row 1 ($n=1$ mode), the topologically-unstable domain walls in row 2 ($n=10$ modes) begin to dissolve ($n=100$ modes) into  topologically stable CSD-phase defects, namely coherence vortices. As mentioned previously, an indicator of coherence-vortex cores is any points where all CSD phase-value colors converge like spokes on a wheel, with an associated vanishing of $|W(x,y,x_B,y_B)|$.  Such coherence vortices are evident in both the third ($n=100$ modes) and fourth ($n=1000$ modes) rows of the middle column.  For example, in the $n=1000$ case, the point $B$ (shown as a dark circle in the bottom row of the middle column) lies midway between a coherence vortex--antivortex dipole with topological charges of $m = \pm 1$. Another feature evident in the CSD is its speckled  structure in the $n=100$ case.  Such a ``patchy'' structure, which is also observed e.g.~in the Wigner function associated with chaotic quantum systems \cite{Zurek}, will evidently influence quantities that are derived from the cross-spectral density via suitable coarse-graining.

\end{figure*}

As a third and final example, when $\vec{r_2}$ is set to position $C$, we have the plot of the phase $\Phi(x,y,x_C,y_C)$ of the CSD, as shown in the right column of Fig.~\ref{pointP}.  Unlike the previous two examples, now the fixed spatial coordinate $C$ lies outside the dominant first mode's intensity distribution, but within the region where the spectral density of the entire beam is non-negligible.  We again see the previously-described trends, but with the (generic, stable) coherence vortices being somewhat more prevalent in other columns of the figure.  Also, in the $n=1000$ case, a weak speckled halo persists about the core patch where the CSD has non-negligible modulus.    

\section{Simulations of propagated beams}

The calculation of the coherent mode decomposition for the undulator radiation has been performed in the source plane, located in the middle of the undulator. It is more realistic to propagate the radiation downstream from the source, e.g.~to a position in which a potential two-slit Young experiment would be feasible. As mentioned earlier, the propagated CSD is calculated by adding  propagated coherent modes. Propagation is performed using a Fourier representation of the Fresnel propagator, including a zoom factor \cite{schmidt,pirro} that enables adaptation of the window for different propagated distances. The propagated first-mode and total spectral density at a distance $z=30$~m is shown in Fig.~\ref{spectral_density_propagated}. The FWHM of the spectral density is 431$\times$316 $\mu$m$^2$. Again, for a consistency check, this size can be compared with the propagation (30~m) of the beam divergence estimated as the convolution of the undulator emission divergence $\sigma'_\gamma=0.68\sqrt{\lambda/L}$ with the electron divergences ($\sigma'_x$=3.64 $\mu$rad and $\sigma'_y$=1.37 $\mu$ rad giving 498$\times$366 $\mu$m$^2$ FWHM.).

Before proceeding further, recall that Fresnel diffraction of a coherent field through a distance $z>0$ will result in development of a ``curvature of field'' coherent background.  This  amounts to a multiplicative factor of $\exp[ik(x^2+y^2)/(2z)]$ that serves as an envelope which multiplies the propagated field: see e.g.~page 16 of the text by Paganin \cite{paganin_book}.  When combined with the expression for the CSD in Eq.~\ref{eq:CSD}, we see that the CSD develops a curvature of field $\Phi_C$ given by
%
\begin{eqnarray}
\nonumber\Phi_C(x_1,y_1,z_1,x_2,y_2,z_2,\omega) \quad\quad\quad\quad\quad\quad \\ =\exp\left[\frac{ik}{2}\left(\frac{x_2^2+y_2^2}{z_2}-\frac{x_1^2+y_1^2}{z_1}\right)\right].    
\label{eq:CSD-curvature-of-field}
\end{eqnarray}
%
This curvature has been subtracted from all further CSD phase maps in the present paper, to avoid the domain walls and coherence vortices being rendered unclear by a strong continuous parabolic-wave background, with respect to which such topological defects are invariant.    

\textcolor{red}{THE REMAINING PARAGRAPHS OF THIS SECTION WILL BE REVISED ONCE THE FIGURES HAVE BEEN FINALISED.}

For the simulations presented here, the CSD has been propagated from the source to distances $z=1,5,30$~m. The CSD phase $\Phi$ has been calculated as a function of $\vec{r}_1$ for different fixed points $\vec{r}_2=A',B',C'$. These fixed points depend on $z$. For $z=30$~m, the coordinates have been selected to be homethetic with respect to the position of $A, B, C$ at the source. That is, the FWHM$_x$ and FWHM$_y$ values at the source for the $x$ and $y$ directions, respectively, transversely scale linearly into the propagated ${\rm FWHM}'_x$ and ${\rm FWHM}'_y$ with ratio $\gamma_{x,y}(z=30)={\rm FWHM}'_{x,y}/{\rm FWHM}_{x,y}$.
For other distances $\gamma_{x,y}(z)= \gamma_{x,y}(z=30) z / 30.0$. Figure~\ref{pointC_propagated} shows the phase map at propagation distances of $1$, $10$ and $30$~m for point $C'$. For $z=30$~m the far-field regime is attained. In the Fraunhofer regime, the shape of the intensity of the coherent modes is not changed, it only expands with distance. A similar behaviour is expected with the phase. The rich speckle structure of the phase map makes it technically difficult to look to the details and identify the exact position and neighbourhood of the coherence vortices and domain walls. It is therefore more interesting to look to closer propagation distances, $z=1,5$~m (near field).  The results at $z=1$~m and at $z=5$~m show a structure in the phase maps rich in coherence vortices and domain walls for $n=10,100$, manifesting that we are in the near field regime.

Next, we want to see how the phase maps evolve in the neighbourhood of a propagated distance. For that a situation with a map rich in vortices with resolution that allows to study the variations. Ideally, the map for $z$=1~m and $n$=100 could be selected, but we preferred to go to longer distance (position where it would be feasible to have a measurement) and reduce the maximum mode. Selecting $z$=5$\pm$1~m and $n$=20 we "scanned" the phase map along 1~m keeping fixed the point C'. Figure~\ref{neighbour} shows the result. One can observe the persistence of some vortices from one image to the next one, but with some displacement. It evidences that the $(x,y)$ coordinates of a given vortex evolves with $z$, and may eventually disappear. The creation of a vortex in $(x,y)$ is also possible when $z$ is scanned. Moreover, a vortex and ``anti-vortex'' pair could nucleate or annihilate at a certain point following a complex dynamics \cite{TopologicalReactionsCohVortices, Marasinghe2011}.

Note that the curvature of field, as given in Eq.~\ref{eq:CSD-curvature-of-field}, has been removed from all plots.}
\label{neighbour}%file: plot_sequence.py
\end{figure*}

Last, we want to simulate a sort of Young experiment by placing two circular apertures in the plane to where the CSD has been propagated ($z$=5~m downstream of the source). These apertures are at points $(x_D,y_D)$=(-10$\mu m$,-25$\mu m$) and its opposite $(x_E,y_E)$=(10$\mu m$,25$\mu m$). The diameter of the apertures is of 3.6 and 3$\mu m$ for points $D$ and $E$, respectively. The radiation that goes through the apertures is propagated 30~m downstream the plane with the apertures. At the image plane a screen is placed to record the spectral density. When the apertures are illuminated by a mostly coherent source an interference pattern with fringes is produced. \textcolor{blue}{Figure~\ref{young} (top)}  shows the interference pattern produced by the CSD calculating using only the zeroth mode (complete coherence). It can be observed a strong visibility or contrast in the fringes, as expected for a  fully coherent source. Adding coherent modes in the construction of the CSD will reduce progressively the visibility (see pattern up to mode 3 in \textcolor{blue}{Fig.~\ref{young}}). However, adding the mode index 4 in the construction of the CSD will drastically reduce the contrast in the fringes, because now the CSD presents a vortex in $E$. The mode 5 will not modify substantially the situation, but mode 6 pushes the vortex outside the aperture $E$ recovering some visibility. This situation repeats several times as one increases the number of modes that contribute to the CSD. For example, the CSD built with modes up to 18 does not present a vortex in $E$, but up to mode 20 it does. Increasing the number of modes used for building the CSD makes an the beam less and less coherent, and the fringes visibility is then lost, about the 99th mode. This numeric experiments shows how catching a coherence vortex in a pinhole will reduce significantly the visibility of the diffracted fringes, evidencing the fact that a beam with high coherence may, in these cases, behave as a beam with much less coherence in terms of fringe visibility. This may certainly led to errors when using the fringes visibility to measure beam coherence.  

It is interesting to remark that although this procedure of adding modes to built the CSD is an artificial way to study the visibility depending on the beam coherence, in a real a synchrotron experiment the beamline optics play a similar role. Some optical elements of the beamline (ideal reflectors, ideal focusing elements) do not alter the occupation spectrum of the modes. They are non-absorbing elements that conserve the Smith-Helmholtz invariant. However, if an optical element remove photons from the beam, or ``cuts'' intensity, then its effect is different on the different modes. The new transformed ``modes'' can be used to build the CSD, but they cannot be considered coherent modes as they are not longer an orthonormal basis for expanding the CSD. A new coherent mode decomposition could be calculated on the transmitted CSD in order to obtain the new coherent modes. In the case of slits or pinholes centered on the optical axis, the lower coherent modes localised near the center of the beam axis will propagate, whereas the higher coherent modes that extend far from the axis will be absorbed. This will push the occupation spectrum to the lower modes with a consequent increase of coherence fraction but an obvious decrease of the spectral density (total intensity).

\section{Discussion}

{\color{red} NEED TO TIE THE DISCUSSION A  LITTLE CLOSER TO THE SIMULATIONS THAT HAVE BEEN ADDED SINCE THE DISCUSSION WAS FIRST DRAFTED.}

{\color{red} This needs to be included somewhere in the discussion: Coherence vortices are seen to persist even if the most populated coherent mode has a relatively large fraction of the total optical power, corresponding to a high coherent fraction and a source that has a high degree of coherence.}

This discussion in broken into three sub-sections.  Section~\ref{subsec:Discussion-part-1} considers the influence of CSD correlation singularities, and the closely related phenomenon of CSD speckles, on measured spectral densities.  Section~\ref{subsec:Discussion-part-2} explores the broad connection between unresolved speckle and the formalism of partially coherent light, with particular reference to the role of CSD correlations singularities in this context.  Finally, Section~\ref{subsec:Discussion-part-3} outlines some possible avenues for future work.  

\subsection{Influence of CSD speckle on measured spectral densities}\label{subsec:Discussion-part-1}

The speckled CSDs, considered in the present paper, will influence measured intensity data in a variety of experiments.  Broadly speaking, the measured intensity data for any particular experiment will involve a coarse-graining over both the CSD and the structure of any sample that may be present, together with any post-undulator optical elements.  The speckled structure of CSDs, such as those considered here, will influence measured intensity data in possibly subtle ways.  We have seen a specific example corresponding to a simple object composed of two point scatterers in Fig.~\ref{young}.  Here, we generalise to a broader class of scattering objects.

Consider the scattered CSD due to the presence of a scalar non-magnetic scattering potential $F(x,y,z,\omega)$ associated with a static sample having complex refractive index $n(x,y,z,\omega)$ \cite{mandel_wolf}:
\begin{equation}
\begin{aligned}
\label{eq:ScatteringPotential}
F(x,y,z,\omega)=\frac{k^2}{4\pi}[n^2(x,y,z,\omega)-1].
\end{aligned}
\end{equation}
Under the first Born approximation, the scattered CSD resulting from an incident CSD $W^{(i)}$ is \cite{wolf_thin_book}:
\begin{equation}
\begin{aligned}
W^{(s)} ({\bf r}_{\perp 1}, z_1=z, & {\bf r}_{\perp 2},z_2=z) \\ 
=  \int \!\!\! \int \!\!\! \int \!\!\! \int \!\!\! \int \!\!\! \int &  W^{(i)}({\bf r}_{\perp 1}',z_1',{\bf r}_{\perp 2}',z_2',\omega)
\\ &\times F^*({\bf r}_{\perp 1}',z_1',\omega)~F({\bf r}_{\perp 2}',z_2',\omega) \\ &\times G^*({\bf r}_{\perp 1},z_1=z;{\bf r}_{\perp 1}',z'_1=z;\omega) \\ &\times G({\bf r}_{\perp 2},z_2=z;{\bf r}_{\perp 2}',z'_2=z;\omega) \\ &\times d{\bf r}_{\perp 1}'~dz'_1~{\bf r}_{\perp 2}'~dz'_2,
\label{eq:CSDScatteringFirstBornApproximation}
\end{aligned}
\end{equation}
where
\begin{equation}
\begin{aligned}
G( & {\bf r}_{\perp 1},z_1; {\bf r}_{\perp 2},z_2;\omega) \\ &=\frac{\exp[i \omega c^{-1}\sqrt{ | {\bf r}_{\perp 2}-{\bf r}_{\perp 1}|^2+(z_1-z_2)^2}]}{\sqrt{| {\bf r}_{\perp 2}-{\bf r}_{\perp 1}|^2+(z_1-z_2)^2}}
\end{aligned}
\end{equation}
is the outgoing free-space Green function for the Helmholtz equation, and  ${\bf r}_{\perp j}\equiv(x_j,y_j)$ where $j=1,2$.

Consider a sample that consists of a pair of point-like scatterers, whose positions happen to coincide with the locations $A=({\bf r}_{\perp 1}'',z'')$ and $B=({\bf r}_{\perp 2}'',z'')$ associated with a coherence-vortex core. This amounts to \textcolor{blue}{Fig.~\ref{loss_of_fringe_visibility}a}, with the screen removed and the pinholes at $A$ and $B$ being replaced with small scatterers at the same locations.  The associated scattering potential is:
\begin{equation}
\begin{aligned}
F({\bf r}_{\perp},z,\omega) &= \mathcal{A}(\omega)~ \delta({\bf r}_{\perp}-{\bf r}_{\perp 1}'',z-z'',\omega) \\ &+ \mathcal{B}(\omega) ~\delta({\bf r}_{\perp}-{\bf r}_{\perp 2}'',z-z'',\omega),
\label{eq:ScatteringPotentialTwoDots}
\end{aligned}
\end{equation}
where the scattering amplitudes $\mathcal{A}$ and $\mathcal{B}$ are complex functions of energy $\hbar\omega$, and $\delta$ is a Dirac delta in three-dimensional space.   Since $W^{(i)}({\bf r}_{\perp 1}'',z'',{\bf r}_{\perp 2}'',z'',\omega)$ vanishes on account of the coherence vortex, and the Hermitian character of the CSD \cite{mandel_wolf} implies that $W^{(i)}({\bf r}_{\perp 2}'',z'',{\bf r}_{\perp 1}'',z'',\omega)$ also vanishes, substitution of Eq.~\ref{eq:ScatteringPotentialTwoDots} into Eq.~\ref{eq:CSDScatteringFirstBornApproximation} leads to:
\begin{equation}
\begin{aligned}
\label{eq:CSDsforTwoScattersAtCVCore}
W^{(s)} ({\bf r}_{\perp 1}, &z_1=z, {\bf r}_{\perp 2},z_2=z) \\ = ~ &W^{(s)}_A ({\bf r}_{\perp 1}, z_1=z,  {\bf r}_{\perp 2},z_2=z) \\ &+ W^{(s)}_B ({\bf r}_{\perp 1}, z_1=z, {\bf r}_{\perp 2},z_2=z).

\end{equation}
Here, $W^{(s)}_A ({\bf r}_{\perp 1}, z_1=z, {\bf r}_{\perp 2},z_2=z)$ is the scattered CSD that would have been obtained if the scatterer at $A$ were to be present but the scatterer at $B$ were to be removed, with $W^{(s)}_B ({\bf r}_{\perp 1}, z_1=z, {\bf r}_{\perp 2},z_2=z)$ being the scattered CSD that would have been obtained if the scatterer at $B$ were to be present but the scatterer at $A$ were to be removed.  
{\bf MSR: This addition of $W$ is interesting and could be checked numerically. In \textcolor{blue}{Fig~\ref{young}} I propagated $W$ five meters to a plane where I put the apertures D and E. I apply the apertures to all modes to I have $W_{D,E}$ that I propagate 30m to the image plane where I calculate the Spectral Density $W_{DE}^{prop}(x,y,x,y)$. As theory suggest $W_{E,F}^{prop}=W_{E}^{prop}+W_{F}^{prop}$ so we can compare for instance the phase of $W$. The problem is that the apertures of slits are not additionable. Solid stoppers would be additionable, but a slit acts a a ``negative'' object, just absorbing everything out of it. MAY BE FOR THE FUTURE...}
Upon setting ${\bf r}_{\perp 1}={\bf r}_{\perp 2}$ to convert the CSD into the spectral density, we see that the spectral densities scattered from $A$ and $B$ respectively, merely add incoherently, with the usual interference term that would otherwise be present in the spectral interference law \cite{mandel_wolf} being suppressed by the coherence vortex.  Thus, if the pair of scatterers at $A$ and $B$, the scattering from which produces no interference fringes, were to be rigidly transversely displaced or rotated in the beam, such that the pair of scatterers no longer coincided with a coherence vortex, the interference term in the spectral interference law would cease to be suppressed and Young-type fringes would appear on account of the superposing of the now-partially-correlated radiation emanating from each of the scatterers.  The concept of a transverse coherence length, which is meaningful in both a conceptual and a computational sense when the pair of scatterers do not coincide with a pair of transverse coordinates associated with a coherence vortex, ceases to be meaningful (and generates the incorrect expectation of Young-type fringes associated with partially correlated disturbances emanating from the pair of scatterers) when the pair of scatterers coincides with a coherence vortex.     

The above conclusion is illustrated in \textcolor{blue}{Fig.~\ref{fig:ABCD}}.  Here, as before, the pair of points $A$ and $B$ correspond to a coherence-vortex core, when both of these points lie in the plane $\alpha$. The locations $C$ and $D$ in the plane $\alpha$, do not correspond to a coherence vortex.  When a point scatterer is placed at $A$ and $C$ in the plane $\alpha$, for example, and the resulting cross-spectral density propagated to the downstream plane $\beta$ and thence used to compute the measured spectral density, \textcolor{blue}{Fig.~\ref{fig:ABCD}a} results.  Here, Young-type interference fringes are formed, with a non-maximal visibility on account of the fact that the radiation is partially coherent.  If the pair of scatterers is instead located at $A$ and $B$, corresponding to a coherence vortex core, the associated fringe visibility drops to zero---see \textcolor{blue}{Fig.~\ref{fig:ABCD}b}.  If one were to have three scatterers, say at $A$ and $B$ and $C$ in the plane $\alpha$, then one would would observe a spectral density such as that shown in \textcolor{blue}{Fig.~\ref{fig:ABCD}c}, with interference fringes being present due to the overlap of radiation scattered from $A$ and $C$, and also from $B$ and $C$, but with no fringes resulting from the superposition of the radiation scattered from $A$ and $B$. No such fringe-suppression occurs in \textcolor{blue}{Fig.~\ref{fig:ABCD}d}, when the three scatterers are placed at $B,C$ and $D$.

\end{figure}

As a related but more realistic example of the  influence that coherence vortices can have on measured x-ray spectral densities, consider the scenario shown in \textcolor{blue}{Fig.~\ref{fig:ImagingWithCoherenceVortex}}.  Here, we have replaced the previously-considered pair of point scatterers, referred to above, with an arbitrary assemblage of scatterers ({\em i.e.} an ``object''), and supplanted the first Born approximation with the projection approximation \cite{paganin_book}.  The thin object, with complex transmission function $T({\bf r}_{\perp},\omega)$ is assumed to lie immediately upstream of the plane $z=Z$, with an object-to-detector distance $\Delta > 0$.  Use the coherent-mode expansion to write down the CSD in the plane $z=Z^-$ immediately upstream of the object, then apply the projection approximation to multiply each of the (paraxial) coherent modes by the complex transmission function of the object.  Next, use the Rayleigh-Sommerfeld diffraction integrals of the first kind \cite{Rayleigh, Sommerfeld, mandel_wolf} to propagate each coherent mode from the nominally planar exit surface $z=Z^+$ of the object to the detector plane at $z=Z+\Delta$.  This leads to the following CSD for pairs of points on the detector surface:     
\begin{equation}
\begin{aligned}
\label{eq:CSD_with_object_and_detector}
W ({\bf r}_{\perp 1}, {\bf r}_{\perp 2},z_1 &=z_2=Z+\Delta,\omega) \\ =\sum_m \lambda_m({\omega}) & \left\{ [\phi_m^*({\bf r}_{\perp 1},\omega)~T^*({\bf r}_{\perp 1},\omega)]\star_1 K({\bf r}_{\perp 1},\Delta,\omega)\right\} \\ \times & \left\{ [\phi_m({\bf r}_{\perp 2},\omega)~T({\bf r}_{\perp 2},\omega)]\star_2 K({\bf r}_{\perp 2},\Delta,\omega)\right\},
\end{aligned}
\end{equation}
where 
\begin{equation}
K=-\frac{1}{2\pi} \frac{\partial}{\partial z} G({\bf r}_{\perp},z,{\bf 0}_{\perp},0;\omega) 
\end{equation}
is the Rayleigh-Sommerfeld convolution kernel, ${\bf 0}_{\perp}\equiv (0,0)$ and $\star_{1,2}$ denotes convolution with respect to ${\bf r}_{\perp 1}$ and ${\bf r}_{\perp 2}$ respectively.  Maps of the corresponding spectral density, obtained by setting ${\bf r}_{\perp 1}={\bf r}_{\perp 2}\equiv{\bf r}_{\perp 1}$ in the CSD, may be viewed as interferograms or inline holograms that are generated by a many point scatterers.   

\begin{figure}
\includegraphics[width=8.5cm]{Figures/ImagingWithCoherenceVortex.png}
\caption{A statistically stationary X-ray source $S$ generates a paraxial CSD illuminating the nominally planar entrance surface $z=Z^-$ of a thin object $O$.

\label{fig:ImagingWithCoherenceVortex}
\end{figure}

Whether one considers a pair of point scatterers under the first Born approximation as described by Eqs.~\ref{eq:ScatteringPotential}-\ref{eq:CSDsforTwoScattersAtCVCore}, or a thin object (continuously infinite set of many point scatterers) under the projection approximation as described by Eq.~\ref{eq:CSD_with_object_and_detector}, a similar conclusion is reached regarding the influence of coherence vortices (and the closely related speckle structure in the CSD) on measured spectral densities.  That is, pairs of points in the scattering sample, which happen to coincide with a coherence vortex, will yield a pair of uncorrelated scattered disturbances for which no interference fringes will be formed.  Thus the presence of coherence vortices will influence measured spectral densities, in an effect that in our view warrants further consideration by the x-ray imaging community.  

This is indicative of two broader points that form a key motivation for the present paper: (i) Coherence vortices and domain walls will exist in most non-trivial x-ray fields, and as such an understanding of their existence will deepen our understanding of imaging and diffraction data obtained using such fields. (ii) Such coherence singularities influence the images that one takes, in ways that may lead to misleading results if one simply ignores their existence.   

\subsection{On the role of unresolved speckle in partial coherence}\label{subsec:Discussion-part-2}

Unresolved speckle lies at the core of many phenomena exhibited by partially coherent classical optical fields in general, and classical x-ray fields in particular \cite{Nugent2003,paganin_book,Nesterets2008}.  Here, speckles are considered to be unresolved if they are coarse grained over space (via the spatial extent of a detector pixel) or coarse-grained over time (via the acquisition time during which photons are detected).  ``Speckle'' is here used in a broad sense to describe functions that exhibit rapid variation with respect to spatial (and, where appropriate, temporal) variables, a definition which is more suitable for our purposes than merely equating the term ``speckle'' with ``fully developed speckle''. We amplify these comments below.  

As a first example, consider the time-dependent and position-dependent intensity $I(x,y,y)=|\Psi(x,y,t)|^2$ of a partially coherent beamlike paraxial field illuminating a given region $\Omega$ of a planar detector, over a given time interval of duration $T$.  Typically, considered as an instantaneous function of any particular fixed time, the field will be a highly speckled function of position $(x,y)$.  These speckles will typically evolve appreciably over time-scales on the order of the coherence time of the partially coherent field.  The characteristic transverse extent of these speckles may be rather small, and---for the case of fully developed speckle, which is in fact {\em typical} when considering the {\em instantaneous} intensity $I(x,y,t)$ of a classical partially coherent scalar field---on average there will be one vortex in the instantaneous phase $\varphi(x,y,t=t_0)=\textrm{Arg} ~\Psi(x,y,t=t_0)$, for each of the speckles.  These speckles are coarse-grained in both space and time, due to the pixel size of the detector, and the acquisition time of the detector, respectively.  The phase-vortex velocities will typically evolve in a highly non-linear and indeed chaotic manner with time \cite{Alperin2019}. It is the spatio-temporally coarse-grained intensity distribution that is manifest as partial coherence, namely a loss of the maximal visibility associated with fully developed speckle \cite{paganin_book}.  

The concept of unresolved speckle harmonises with the idea that {\em spatio-temporal coarse-graining influences the degree to which the coherence of the field influences the measured intensity data.}  We have already given the example of such coarse-graining of dynamic spatio-temporal speckles, in the previous paragraph.  One could also consider the simpler case of static fully-developed coherent speckle, which does not vary with time but which is highly speckled in space.  Such a speckled beam would typically be littered with a spatially random ``gas'' of static phase vortices, with a statistically equal number of clockwise and anti-clockwise vortices, again averaging one such vortex per speckle \cite{Goodman2007,paganin_book}.  Classically, the intensity of the field will vanish at the vortex cores \cite{Dirac1931}, which may be viewed as a manifestation of excellent coherence insofar as the visibility of the generalized interference ``fringes'', namely speckle, approaches unity.  However, this near-unity visibility will only be manifest if one's detector has sufficiently fine pixels, namely pixel dimensions that are significantly smaller than the transverse length scale associated with the speckles.  If, conversely, exactly the same temporally-static fully-developed coherent speckle field were to have its intensity measured with a pixellated detector whose dimension are much larger than the characteristic speckle size, then the resulting coarse-grained intensity map would be rather smooth, hence of correspondingly low visibility, and correspondingly low ``coherence''.  What is surprising about the coherence domain walls and vortices, when viewed from this perspective, is their association with pairs of points for which there is not just low coherence, but {\em zero} coherence.     

For a third and final example, of the fact that spatio-temporal coarse-graining influences the effective degree of coherence that is manifest in optical experiments utilising partially coherent radiation, we recall the classic experiment of Magyar and Mandel \cite{MagyarMandel1963}.  This paper considers the Young-type interference fringes produced by superposing independent maser beams, which are detectable provided that the exposure time is sufficiently small and the beam sufficiently bright.  Here, ``sufficiently small'' means ``smaller than reciprocal of the spread of temporal frequencies, namely the coherence time''.  For such experiments, ensemble-averaged quantities such as the CSD are not applicable.  Classically, for example, one may have two independent quasi-monochromatic sources whose relative phases drift over times on the order of the coherence time.  One will therefore measure Young-type fringes in a random position if the exposure time is shorter than the coherence time and there are enough photons registered to form an image; these fringes will be washed out if the exposure time is significantly longer than the coherence time, corresponding to temporal coarse graining over this time.  Also, even if the exposure time is sufficiently small compared to the coherence time for fringes to persist after temporally averaging over the measurement interval, they will only be resolved if the spatial averaging implied by the pixel size does not smear the said fringes away.  This may be immediately applied to a coherence-vortex context: If two points in space are such that the magnitude of $W$ vanishes at some given angular frequency, then (i) the combination of disturbances scattering from each point will yield time-averaged Young-type interference fringes with zero visibility, but (ii) if the intensity were to be averaged over timescales much shorter than the coherence time, instantaneous Young-type fringes of non-zero visibility and would indeed be observed.   

Spatio-temporal coarse-graining of speckles is implicit in the formalism of CSD phase domain walls and CSD coherence vortices.  Since we are working with a space--frequency description of partially coherent radiation \cite{Wolf1982}, the time variable has been Fourier transformed away, leaving us with spatial coarse-graining over unresolved speckles, together with energy coarse-graining over the energy resolution $\Delta(\hbar\omega)$ associated with the detector.  These speckles, initially present in the physical fields underpinning the calculation of a given CSD, mutate into the speckled CSD structures that will often be present in the CSD for realistic sources such as the modern x-ray undulator considered here.  This serves to {\em nuance the concept of a coherence area}, in the sense that the area of the region $\Omega$ in $(x,y)$ space, centred on $(x_0,y_0)$, where $|W(x_0,y_0,x,y)|$ is non-negligible, defines a coherence area in the usual sense of the term.  However, if the patch $\Omega$ of $xy$-space (where $|W(x_0,y_0,x,y)|$ is non-negligible) possesses speckle structure then it is chopped up into fragments of a {\em second, smaller characteristic length scale associated with the CSD speckles}.  These CSD speckles are co-located next to coherence vortices (or coherence domain walls) where the CSD vanishes, with such points typically lying within $\Omega$.  Thus CSD domain walls and/or vortices lie at the boundary of each fragment.  As a simple example of this, the second row of Fig.~\ref{pointP} has the ``first coherence area'' (region where $|W|$ is non-negligible) chopped up into 9 (left column) or 10 (middle and right columns) fragments that are separated by domain walls.  More complicated examples of the same idea are given in the later, more highly speckled, CSD phase maps such as those in the third row of Fig.~\ref{pointC_propagated}.

It is also worth mentioning that the term ``coherence vortex'', which is used in conformity with the existing literature, is something of a misnomer.  This is because such structures have cores that corresponds to pairs of spatial points where the CSD vanishes (at a given angular frequency).  This is therefore a structure, albeit a vortical one on account of the associated phase winding, that heralds an {\em absence} of coherence. Along these lines, one may loosely speak coherence-vortex cores as topologically induced coordinate pairs for which there is ``complete destructive interference of coherence''.

The web of incoherence associated with coherence vortices is four-dimensional, and embedded in six dimensions \cite{Marasinghe2010}, when considering the CSD to be a function of the transverse coordinates $(x_1,y_1)$ and $(x_2,y_2)$, together with the propagation distance $z_1=z_2=z$ and the energy $\hbar\omega$.  This web of incoherence, embedded within the CSD, is naturally formed rather than being an exotic construct, in a manner not unrelated to the spontaneous formation of a gas of phase vortices in the complex wave-field associated with fully developed speckle \cite{OHolleran2008}.  Such a web of incoherence influences, for example, spectral densities calculated by setting both spatial coordinates equal after the integration in Eq.~\ref{eq:CSDScatteringFirstBornApproximation}.  The implication is that infinitely many pairs of points, within a given scattering volume, generate scattered radiation that is incoherently superposed, even though the incident radiation is partially coherent.

% Let us now investigate this ``web of incoherence'' in a little more detail.  There will be a healing length associated with phase vortices.  Hence there is some thickness, as it were, to the zero sheets. This corresponds to a certain volume of the space (in which $W$ lives) being incoherent.  As the density of coherence vortices increases, the relative volume (occupied by $W$) for which $W$ is small will increase.  Hence one measure of coherence is given by the volume (four-dimensional area) of the nodal sheets of $W$.  Also relevant is the phase windings associated with coarse graining over $W$ in order to derive some measured quantity.  The phase windings make the field look incoherent when suitably coarse grained, due to phase windings giving all phases and an associated net cancellation of phase effects, which yet again brings us back to the starting statement regarding unresolved speckle being at the heart of partial coherence. 

% Cite Zernike paper on fringe visibility as degree of coherence -- generalise this to speckle visibility, both before and after coarse graining -- the (perceived) degree of coherence depends on the spatial and temporal length scales over which one coarse grains.  The speckle is intrinsic to partial coherence.  It is present in multiple representations -- the space--time representation discussed above, but also what is much less appreciated, it is also present in other representations such as the space--frequency description {\em provided} one does not coarse-grain beforehand.

% Then drag the discussion to much more pragmatic level, re: how an appreciation of such speckle is essential for proper understanding of modern x-ray sources.  Analogy: intensity speckles became important to understand once visible-light sources (i.e. lasers) become coherent enough for speckles to be manifest.  Similarly, now that x-ray sources are sufficiently coherent, intensity speckles matter (cf. use of rotating blocks of wood as speckle suppressors, in the early days of third-generation x-ray synchrotrons) and so too do speckles in the CSD.  Crude CSD models do not reveal this behaviour, but for non-trivial systems, speckled CSDs become the norm. Reason: Multi-wave interference of three or more waves is needed (Nye + Wolf on three-pinhole interferometer + Ruben and Paganin + Marasinghe). This is a key message of the present paper. 

\subsection{Further work on x-ray coherence vortices}\label{subsec:Discussion-part-3}

\subsubsection{Topological reactions of x-ray correlation singularities} A first interesting topic for future work would be the {\em topological reactions} associated with x-ray coherence vortices \cite{GburSPIE,TopologicalReactionsCohVortices,Marasinghe2010}.  If the two-dimensional plots of the CSD phase, as given in this paper, were to be extended into a third dimension---e.g.~by allowing the transverse coordinates of $\vec{r}_2$ to vary, in addition to the transverse coordinates $(x,y)$ of $\vec{r}_1$---one would expect such topological reactions to occur.  Such topological reactions include the annihilation of a clockwise coherence vortex with a anti-clockwise coherence vortex and the spontaneous creation of a clockwise--anti-clockwise pair of coherence vortices \cite{TopologicalReactionsCohVortices}.  Other topological reactions are possible such as the decay of higher-order coherence vortices to multiple lower-order coherence vortices \cite{TopologicalReactionsCohVortices}, together with mutual annihilation of a CSD phase saddle-point and a local phase maximum or minimum.  Note that the topological conservation laws for coherence vortices (i.e.~conservation of topological charge) must be augmented with a second conservation law (conservation of topological index) when coherence vortices are considered in relation to maxima, minima and saddle points of CSD phase \cite{MaysPonsaingPaganin2018}.  

\subsubsection{Relation between x-ray CSD coherence vortices and CSD domain walls} Both CSD coherence vortices and CSD phase domain walls arose in the present study.  We have already emphasized that the former class of correlation singularity is topologically stable, whereas the latter class is not.  The reason that domain walls are observed at all is that they are associated with standing waves in modal decompositions, with associated nodal regions that are lines along two-dimensional cross sections of $\Phi$.  In regions where there is one predominant mode of higher order than the typically-nodeless dominant mode, such domain walls may naturally be found.  Moreover, notwithstanding their lack of topological stability, they may nevertheless be present since the lack of a three-beam condition for vortex formation \cite{ThreeBeamCondition} forbids their decay to a more generically stable coherence vortex.  Interestingly, a greater region of the CSD domain is pushed to zero by the unstable phase domain walls, since these occupy a set of nodal points with one higher dimension than the coherence vortices to which they subsequently decay as more modes are added.  Note also that domain walls may be transformed into vortices in certain contexts \cite{PaganinOptLett2018}.  Further study into such questions, regarding the relation between CSD coherence vortices and CSD domain walls, would be an interesting topic for further investigation.  

\subsubsection{Tensorial x-ray correlation defects} Another suggestion, for further work in the area covered by the present paper, lies in the fact that x-rays are vector fields rather than scalar field.  The correlation singularities considered in the present paper, assume a more general character when the vector character of the electromagnetic field cannot be ignored.  In such cases, which may become progressively more important in coming years, the cross-spectral density generalizes from a complex scalar field to a tensor field \cite{mandel_wolf,wolf_thin_book}.  This correlation tensor is of second rank for paraxial fields, and of third rank for non-paraxial fields.  Note also, than when considering partial coherence for vector electromagnetic fields, partial polarisation should also be taken into account \cite{wolf_thin_book}.  The key point is, that just as the scalar cross-spectral density admits topological defects such as CSD-phase coherence vortices and domain walls, the CSD tensors associated with partially coherent (and partially polarised) vectorial electromagnetic fields will also admit defects.  The permissible defects in such correlation tensors are classifiable via homotopy theory \cite{VilenkinShellard1994,Volovik2003}.  It would be interesting to explore the topological defects associated with CSD tensors, and associated multi-component coherence functions, in addition to the multi-point coherence functions associated with non-Gaussian fields in both the scalar and vector cases.  Coherence skyrmions, coherence textures and other exotic tensorial defects would be likely to emerge, the classification and consequences of which would form an interesting avenue for future work.

\textcolor{red}{
\subsubsection{Experimental observation} 
To the best of our knowledge, at the time of this writing there is no experimental evidence of CSD vortices in the X-ray domain.  The planning of an experiment to observe  coherence vortices therefore attracts our attention. There could be several reasons why these singularities have not been detected so far. One reason may be due to the speckled structure of the phase of the CSD, that is increasingly apparent when propagating at long distances, as is mostly the case in synchrotron beams. This is evidencied in \textcolor{blue}{Fig.~\ref{spectral_density_propagated}} where propagation at a long distance (30~m) shows much more speckles than for shorter distances. Another reason is the practical impossibility to work with circular apertures with diameter that tend to zero. It would be desirable to position these almost-zero-diameter pinholes in a position where a singularity exists. Hovewer, for practical reasons this is impossible, thus an aperture with finite size averages the CSD over an area that includes more than the vortex. This is manifested in our simulations (\textcolor{blue}{Fig.~\ref{young}}) where there is an appreciable change in visibility when a singularity enters in the aperture, but it is not as dramatic as one expect from theory (e.g., \textcolor{blue}{Fig.~\ref{Young_fringe_anholonomy}}, curve 1). It may be also possible that the effect of singularities in the CSD have degraded the coherent properties of existing beams without been recognised by the experimentalists. The effect of reduction of visibility is hardly quantified and a small displacement of one aperture would ``optimize'' the beamline in the sense that the singularity is pushed out from the aperture.}  

The implementation of upgraded storage-rings in synchrotron facilities, like EBS at ESRF, where the coherent fraction would improve roughly by two orders of magnitude, opens the possibility to new experiments. The partial-coherent flux through small pinholes will certainly improve thus Young experiment as discussed in this paper may become feasible. If a beamline images the source on a secundary source where a slit is placed, the slit aperture would act as coherence-mode filter: the closer the aperture, the less modes are transmitted. Therefore, a further screen with a double pinhole and a detector could reproduce the situation presented in \textcolor{blue}{Fig.~\ref{young}}. Moreover, if one pinhole can move in a trajectory around a singularity, ratchening interferometers could be obtained, as explained in \textcolor{blue}{Fig.~\ref{Young_fringe_anholonomy}}. 
\section{Conclusion}

Cross-spectral density correlation singularities, such as coherence vortices and domain walls, were seen to be present in the field generated by a modern x-ray undulator.  Such singularities, which are not present in many simple models for partially coherent sources, often imply a speckled structure in the associated cross-spectral density.  An important implication of such structures is that the powerful \textcolor{red}{but simplistic} concept of a transverse coherence length becomes problematic.  \textcolor{red}{ MOVE TO SECTION 5.3?? Instead, one has two transverse length scales, the smaller of which is associated with the speckle-size of the cross-spectral density, and the larger of which is associated with the usual definition of transverse coherence.}  Several other implications, of x-ray coherence vortices upon measured cross-spectral densities, were considered.   Avenues for future work were briefly considered, such as their generalization to higher-order topological defects in the tensorial two-point correlation functions associated with partially polarised electromagnetic x-ray fields.
